# Week 1 – PromptTemplate & LLMChain

✅ What I learned:
- PromptTemplate lets you format prompt strings dynamically
- LLMChain is a simple way to run a model on a formatted prompt

❓ Questions I still have:
- When should I split logic into multiple chains?
- How do I use variables in a more complex template?

💡 Idea:
Try building a small chatbot that rewrites messages in different tones (polite, professional, funny...)
